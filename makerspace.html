        <h2>The Makerspace at USC</h2>
        <p>When I was deciding where to dorm before my arrival at the <a href="https://sc.edu" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="external-link no-image">University of South Carolina</a>, one place made my decision very easy. When I saw the <a href="https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/housing/rhodosfellows/makerspace/index.php" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="external-link no-image">Rhodos Fellows Makerspace</a>, originally in the south quad dorms, I knew I had found home. Upon arrival, I spent numerous days and nights in the makerspace building and creating whatever my heart desired. This place was an escape for me during a difficult transition to college during COVID and served as a home away from home. During my four years at USC, I was a member of the Makerspace community both as a staff member and designer/creator. In both roles, I have had the fortune of meeting some great people with even greater minds. Rarely do you find a place that allows for such creative freedom as this environment. For these reasons, the makerspace will always have a special place in my heart.  </p>
