            <h1>Custom Graduation Cap</h1>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>For my final project at the makerspace I wanted to customize my graduation cap. I knew I wanted to put a quote on cap using the glowforge laser cutter and incorporate electronics somehow into the design.</p>
            <h4>Challenge</h4>
            <p>Modify a graduation cap that incorporates electronics and a quote of my choice without the design being too cumbersome. Also wires for electronics needed to be hid as best as possible.</p>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>An acylic quote by Frank Sinatra, gamecock logo, and USC letters were glued onto the cap. A bluetooth controlled LCD screen was placed on top for an electronic component.</p>
            <h4>Approach</h4>
            <p>While I was thinking of how I wanted to approach the electronic portion of the design, I began brainstorming quotes for my cap. For the next couple of weeks I began searching through all of my songs for a perfect quote. A quote that wouldn't be corny but would have meaning to me. After some time, I settled on a Frank Sinatra - My Way quote: "I did it my way". I've always deeply resonated with this songs message and I try my best to life my life - my way. I cut out the quote with red acrylic on the glowforge laser cutter as well as the USC letters and gamecock logo.</p>
            <p>For the electronic portion, I knew I wanted to have an LED component but couldn't decide what to display on it. One morning, while taking a shower I had the realization that I didn't have to settle for only displaying one phrase on the LCD screen. Only months earlier I had bought an LED hat that I could control via bluetooth on my phone for my friend Emma Grace's birthday bar crawl. I simply pulled out the LED screen and placed it on the cap while hiding the conveniently small charging port and on/off switch under the brim of the cap.</p>
            <h4>Benefits</h4>
            <p>I was able to change the LCD sign all throughout graduation. From displaying "Hi Mom" to fancy animations, I made the commencement ceremony much more entertaining for myself and my neighboring classmates. In addition, I became a landmark during the ceremony for families to find their graduates.</p>
