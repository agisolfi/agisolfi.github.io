            <h1>Personal Website</h1>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>After completing so many projects in my personal, professional, and academic life I wanted one centralized place to store all of my projects. I decided that a personal website would be a great way to store these projects as well as a great way to learn HTML.</p>
            <h4>Challenge</h4>
            <p>Without using a website template, construct a website capable of presenting past projects in a professional yet engaging manner.</p>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>Using HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript a website was created.</p>
            <h4>Approach</h4>
            <p>I first attempted to create this website using a content management system (CMS) called GRAV. I thought this would allow me to make a good looking website while learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript but unfortunately this CMS system ended up impeding my progess. However, using GRAV CMS allowed me to create a temporary website while I forged one I was more proud of. The main issues of this first attempt involved the lack of design freedom in the CMS and my fundamental lack of knowledge of these three languages. I knew the only way to truly make this wesbite they way I wanted was to start from scratch.</p>
            <p>I began by taking a website template and attempting to understand it. When I realized my foundational knowledge wasn't deep enough to even bend this template to my will, I simply started from nothing and added peice by peice until I had the website I wanted and consequently a better knowledge of these languages. I understand this is not the easiest nor fastest method for web develpoment (a coworker once described my approach as the nerd method) but I wanted be able to look at the website I had created and truly understand how it worked. If I simply used a template or a website building service, I would have no idea how it functioned and nothing to be proud of.</p>
            <table>
            <thead>
            <tr>
            <th>Skills Demonstrated</th>
            <th>Project Artifacts</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
            <td>HTML, CSS, Javascript</td>
            <td>This Website</td>
            </tr>
            <td>Git</td>
            <td><a href="https://github.com/agisolfi/agisolfi.github.io">Github Repo</a></td>
            </tbody>
            </table>
            <h4>Benefits</h4>
            <p>By creating this website I have taught myself HTML, CSS, Javascript while utilizing git in my work environment. I now have a much better understanding of how websites work and simultaneously have a medium to share my favorite projects with others.</p>
