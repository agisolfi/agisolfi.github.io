            <h1>Hip Replacement</h1>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>One of the projects of the course: Modeling of Biomedical Systems, involved the 3D design of a unique hip replacement. </p>
            <h4>Challenge</h4>
            <p>Using Creo, students built individual parts of the prosthetic and assembled them for view. The design was to be unique in some way compared to the design currently on the market.</p>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>A multi part hip replacement that contains loops for sutures which would provide added stability.</p>
            <h4>Approach</h4>
            <p>My groups model consisted of four parts: the acetabulum cap, plastic insert, femoral head, and femoral stem. In order to make the design unique, the acetabular cap and the femoral stem contain loops that anchor polypropylene (PP) sutures. This would provide added stability to the implant, especially during motion. The stem and acetabular cap were also textured so that bone can adhere to the material more naturally. Below is some images of the hip replacement.</p>
            <table>
            <thead>
            <tr>
            <th>Skills Demonstrated</th>
            <th>Project Artifacts</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
            <td>3D Modeling - Creo</td>
            <td><a href="../../assets/img/projects/BMEN411 Hip Replacement Project (1).pdf">Project Report</a></td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
            </table>
            <h4>Benefits</h4>
            <p>This hip replacement would provide for a more stable surgery and use afterwards. It also would employ sutures that would snap in cases of serious injury to prevent further damage from occuring by the material being too strong.</p>
