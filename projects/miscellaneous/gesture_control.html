            <h1>Control your Computer using Gestures</h1>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>I wanted to experiment further with Mediapipe's gesture detection and had just discovered pyautogui. I thought it would be cool to try to control my computer using just my webcam and gestures.</p>
            <h4>Challenge</h4>
            <p>Create a program that lets the user control their computer using only thier hands.</p>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>Using Mediapipe's gesture recongition a custom gesture model was created which allows the user to move their cursor, click, scroll, and more through just hand gestures.</p>
            <h4>Approach</h4>
            <p>In order to train my own gesture recongition model, I created a database of example gestures. I took approximately 100 pictures of several hand gestures to controll basic mouse functions. I then fed these images into a python script which trained a model to be used in another python script. This final script determines the location of the hand in the webcam camera and then projects its location to a pyautogui command which moves the cursor to that point on the screen. Pyautogui was also used to control basic commands such as click, scroll, and end the program.</p>
            <table>
            <thead>
            <tr>
            <th>Skills Demonstrated</th>
            <th>Project Artifacts</th>
            </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
            <tr>
            <td>OpenCV, Mediapipe, Gesture Recongition, Pyautogui</td>
            <td><a href= "https://github.com/agisolfi/GestureControl">Github Repo</a></td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
            </table>
            <h4>Benefits</h4>
            <p>This program can make using a computer more accessible, but was created as a learning experiment and likley has no real application.</p>
