            <h1>Custom Model Rockets</h1>
            <h4>Motivation</h4>
            <p>As a child, I used to love to play with model rockets. I have many fond memories of building and launching model rockets with my father and brother. As I grew older, I never lost my interest in rocketry and wished to one day make my own. Now as an engineer I can make this wish a reality and make  a series of these rockets that increase with complexity and efficiency as I learn more about model rocketry.</p>
            <h4>Challenge</h4>
            <p>Making a model rocket with affordable materials.</p>
            <h4>Solution</h4>
            <p>With access to the 3D printers at the makerspace, I decided to make a 3D printed rocket and custom build a launch pad.</p>
            <h4>Approach</h4>
            <p>I used Autodesk Inventor, which I had learned in high school, to 3D model my own rocket. There were two parts to my design: a nose cone and a body with three fins and two lugs for a guide rail. As all great designs must have a name, I decided to name my rocket Eos after the greek goddess of the dawn. </p>
            <p>I bought some D-12 rocket engines from Estes to power the rocket. Although this current model doesn't include a parachute, as I wish to see the full extent of the power of my rocket, I hope to later make my own custom recovery method. Now that the rocket was assembled, I needed to build a launch pad. Using PVC pipe, a metal disk for a deflector plate, and a metal rod for the guide rail, I was able to make a sturdy launch pad with items found at the hardware store. Now I had a homemade version of the rockets I used to play with as a kid.</p>
            <table>
            <thead>
            <tr>
            <th>Skills Demonstrated</th>
            <th>Project Artifacts</th>
            </tr>

            <tbody>
            <tr>

            <td>n/a</td>
            </tr>
            </tbody>
            </table>
            <h4>Benefits</h4>
            <p>This design is cheap but more importantly it is easy to fabricate and reproduce. This will allow for future iterations to be adapted quickly.</p>
